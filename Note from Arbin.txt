This codebase is not complete, here is a list of things the user must do to get it working.
It was the SRC folder from the Actual Dragonball: The Forsaken Future Codebase, copied over
SRC Folder from DBSC 2.5.2.. Pretty much the exact exact same codebase, but none of the Areas
or anything, just all of the new Skills and Races and a Better Ranking system for all the
races done in XML Code.

1. Go through Fierian, Hylian, Reploid, and any other skill sets, and 
   add the appropriet entries in skills.dat.

2. Another big thing are the Classes and Race entries for each, these can just
   be added in for now in the Race and Class folders and setup Online.

3. That should be about it for now, besides following the windows install text.
   and fixing any random bugs that popup, it is smaug...
